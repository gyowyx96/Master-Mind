# Master-Mind

Rules: The object of MASTERMIND is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4
colored pegs. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the
code.

I've made this mini-game for TheOdinProject ruby course.
Feel free to contact me via mail for more information about the code and if you have suggestion would be very appreciated considering that i'm a newb of the programming word.
